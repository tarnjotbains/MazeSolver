# maze-solver 
Implemented random maze generation and pathfinding in Python using PyGame. 

![](maze.gif)
- Represented cells of a maze on a graph in class 'MazeNode'  
- Used DFS to generate a Maze 
- Used Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal path between user placed items. 


### Todo 
 - [x] ~~Add DocString~~
 - [x] ~~Add Visuals to show Dijkstra's Algorithm~~
 - [x] ~~Add Visuals to show Maze Generation~~
 - [x] ~~Functionize parts of the PyGame loop.~~
 - [ ] Restructure the modules? (MVC?) 
 - [ ] Fix Cursor Bug
  
Extras  
 - [ ] Implement pathfinding with A* algorithm 
 - [ ] Implement Prim's maze generation algorithm 
 - [ ] Implement User-Defined Maze Generation
 - [ ] Implement in 3D?
